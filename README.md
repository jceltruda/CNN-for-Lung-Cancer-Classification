# Lung Cancer Classification Model

This project is a learning exercise on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and using PyTorch to develop neural networks for image classification.

The model was trained on a publicly available dataset containing 767 lung CT scans, categorized into four groups: adenocarcinoma, large cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, and normal (non-cancerous) lung tissue. You can access the dataset here: [Lung Cancer Dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/dorsar/lung-cancer).

My model achieved an error rate of 1.695%, with zero false negatives.
